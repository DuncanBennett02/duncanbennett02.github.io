          This is the story of the man who would later be referred to as D. B. Cooper, one of America's most infamous skyjackers. 
          The stunt he is about to pull will place him in the criminal hall of fame for decades to come. It is a heist the likes of 
          which have never been seen before or since, and one of the most puzzling cold cases of all time.

          the flight is uneventful.

          The ransom money and parachutes are brought to the airport by the police and the FBI, and soon the plane is in the air again. 

          Cooper insists they fly to Mexico City, but the pilot informs him there isn't enough fuel. They come to an agreement for a pit stop in Reno.
          
          Cooper also dictates that the aircraft fly at the lowest possible airspeed, stay below ten thousand feet, keep the cabin unpressurized, and keep the landing gear deployed.
