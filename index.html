        level as the header, but it seems like a div can't have both class=row and class=column, adding
        class=row always kicks it down to a new row. Is external CSS the only way to achieve what I want? -->

            Howdy stranger, name's Duncan. Welcome to my GitHub Sandbox. I'm a 22-year-old Senior at Western Washington University 
            studying to complete a major in design and a minor in anthropology. I also work for the department of Off Campus Living as a graphic designer. 
            My hobbies include drawing, skiing, playing video games, and trying to take care of plants. Currently, roughly 75% of my houseplants are what I 
            would call “doing alright”, though I'm trying to get that number up. On this site you will find links to my projects for DSGN 360, Digital Media Design 1. 
            Bling my line if you're looking for a commission or if you wanna carpool to Baker. 
          </p>

          <!-- Basically, I want to move the second text column down without having to add the underscore
          the way that I did. -->

          <p>
            I don't have enough copy to utilize skeleton for exercise 5, so here's a paragraph I had an AI write about "the hobbies of someone named Duncan": 
            Duncan is a passionate individual who enjoys spending his free time engaging in various hobbies. When he is not working, he loves to go hiking in the 
            mountains to appreciate nature's beauty and to challenge himself physically. He also has a keen interest in photography and enjoys capturing the beauty 
            of the world through his camera lens. In addition to these activities, Duncan is also an avid reader and loves to indulge in books and literature whenever 
            he gets the chance.
          </p>
