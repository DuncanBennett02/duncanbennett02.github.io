<p>I am a Senior at Western Washington University studying to complete a major in design and a minor in anthropoplogy.
I enjoy spending time outdoors hiking, camping, and skiing. In my free time I like to play video games and work on personal art projects. I am hard working and always complete assigned work on time. I can work well in groups or on my own and am not afriad to receive critiques or give constructive ciriticism. I will always do my best to listen to what people have to say and offer salient advice.
Please refer to my portfolio for a demonstration of my abilities. Thank you for visiting my webpage.
